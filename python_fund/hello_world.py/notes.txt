#3 types of dictionaries in python:
#--------------------------------------
#list an array that allows you to hold groups of values. uses [] brackets

#tuples an immutable list cannot be changed in anyway -  we don't use this much. uses () parentheses. they get accidentally  made. 

#dictionaries - an unordered collection of objects enclosed by {}  brackets

# x = 7

# if (x ==7):
#     print('x is seven!')

# else:
#     print('x is not seven') #the 4 indents is very important. all indents should be the same multiple. be consistent


#loops

# for x in range (0, 11):
#     print(x) #this will print 1-10
